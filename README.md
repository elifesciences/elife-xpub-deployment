Description
============
An eLife specific implementation of the [xPub][1] submission and peer-review system for scholarly journals. [xPub][1] is a journal publishing workflow implementation of [PubSweet][2], an open toolkit for building publishing workflows.

This is a collaboration between eLife and the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation (Coko), [more information in our press release][3].

This repo contains scripts to synchronise the selected commit of [xPub][1] so that it can be deployed to eLife's instance on AWS using [https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xpub-formula][4]. This repo will also contain any eLife specific components or configuration.
